# WhitLend

**WhitLend** is a comprehensive loan management system designed to help lending businesses manage their entire lending lifecycle - from borrower onboarding through to loan settlement and financial reconciliation.

## What WhitLend Does

WhitLend brings together all aspects of running a lending operation into one place:

- Track borrowers and their contact information
- Create and manage loans with flexible repayment schedules
- Record payments and disbursements
- Manage investor capital and returns
- Reconcile your bank statements with system transactions
- Generate receipts and track expenses
- Monitor loan security/collateral

## Key Features

### Borrower Management
Maintain a complete record of all borrowers including their contact details, identification documents, and lending history. Borrowers can be organised by their primary contact person, making it easy to manage relationships where one person handles multiple borrower entities.

### Loan Products
Define different loan products with their own interest rates, terms, and fee structures. This allows you to offer various lending options while maintaining consistency in how each product type is processed.

### Loan Management
Create loans linked to borrowers and loan products. Each loan tracks:
- Principal amount and disbursement details
- Interest calculations and repayment schedules
- Payment history and outstanding balances
- Loan status (Live, Settled, Pending, Restructured, Defaulted)

### Repayment Schedules
Automatically generate repayment schedules based on loan terms. Track expected vs actual payments to identify arrears and monitor collection performance.

### Investor Management
If your lending is funded by investors, WhitLend tracks:
- Investor profiles and investment products
- Capital contributions and withdrawals
- Interest payments due to investors
- Running balances for each investor

### Financial Tracking

**Ledger**: View a consolidated timeline of all financial movements - loans, repayments, investor transactions, expenses, and other income.

**Receipts**: Generate and manage payment receipts for borrowers. Receipts can be drafted, reviewed, and finalised with proper numbering.

**Expenses**: Record business expenses categorised by type, supporting your financial reporting needs.

**Other Income**: Track non-loan income such as fees, penalties, or miscellaneous revenue.

### Bank Reconciliation
Match your bank statement entries against system transactions to ensure everything is accounted for. The reconciliation feature helps you:
- Import bank statements
- Match bank entries to loans, expenses, investor transactions, and receipts
- Identify unmatched entries on both sides
- Create reconciliation patterns for recurring transactions

### Orphaned Entries
Find system transactions that haven't been linked to a bank statement entry. This "reverse reconciliation" view helps ensure all recorded transactions eventually appear in your bank records - or can be marked as accepted orphans with a reason if they won't appear (e.g., cash transactions, internal adjustments).

### Security & Collateral
Track properties or assets securing loans:
- Property details and valuations
- First charge holder information
- Value history over time
- Link properties to specific loans

### Dashboard
Get an at-a-glance view of your lending portfolio:
- Total loans outstanding
- Collection performance
- Upcoming repayments
- Key financial metrics

### Audit Trail
All significant actions are logged, providing a complete history of who did what and when. This supports accountability and helps with troubleshooting or compliance needs.

## How It All Connects

The system is built around the flow of money through a lending business:

1. **Investors** provide capital which funds **Loans**
2. **Loans** are made to **Borrowers** based on **Loan Products**
3. **Borrowers** make payments according to their **Repayment Schedule**
4. Payments generate **Receipts** and update loan balances
5. The business incurs **Expenses** and may receive **Other Income**
6. All these transactions should eventually appear on **Bank Statements**
7. **Bank Reconciliation** matches system records to bank records
8. **Orphaned Entries** catches anything that hasn't been reconciled
9. The **Ledger** provides a unified view of all financial activity
10. **Investor Interest** is calculated and tracked based on their capital

## Organisation Support

WhitLend supports multiple organisations, each with their own isolated data. Users can be members of multiple organisations and switch between them as needed. This makes it suitable for:
- Managing multiple lending entities
- Separating different loan portfolios
- Multi-branch or franchise operations

## Data Management

The system includes tools for:
- **Importing data** from spreadsheets (borrowers, loans, transactions, investors)
- **Backing up** your organisation's data
- **Restoring** from backups when needed

---

WhitLend aims to replace spreadsheets and manual tracking with a purpose-built system that keeps your lending operation organised, reconciled, and under control.
